<h1>Project Electrum (name TBD)</h1>

This is a repository for the main information website for the hg-engine based ROM Hack named "".

This website contains information for all Pokemon up to Generation IX.

<h2>JavaScript Project Explanation</h2>

I will be working on this website beyond this semester. Since I have no idea where this site will be when you start grading Projects, you may use the release for grading, or you can download the current state of the repo for grading. It does not matter.

Eventually when this site is done, I will find a way to host it externally and have it be an actual site whether that be using some sort of Github hosting, or external server hosting.

<h2>How to set-up (Release):</h2>

On the right side of the page just beneath the <strong>About</strong> section, there is the <strong>Releases</strong> section.

Click on the latest release that is listed there.

On the page it brings you to, under the <strong>Assets</strong> section, click on the .zip file listed and download it.

Locate the .zip file, and extract the folder inside where ever you would like it.

Open the folder and run <strong>index.html</strong>.

<h2>How to set-up (Modern Repo)</h2>

On the main repo page, switch to the master branch.

Click on the green code button and click <h2>Download ZIP</h2>.

Extract the folder anywhere you'd like.

I would recommend using VSCode for actually running the site. You may download VSCode from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

When you open VSCode, click on the extensions button on the far left bar in the application. It is the fifth button down.

Search <strong>Live Server</strong>

The extension you are looking for is made by <strong>Ritwick Dey</strong>. Install that extension.

When it is finished, open the folder you extracted from the zip inside VSCode.

File -> Open Folder -> Locate Folder and open it

When you open the folder, right click on <strong>index.html</strong> and click <strong>Run with Live Server</strong>. It should be the first option.

The site will function as it would if it was hosted externally.
